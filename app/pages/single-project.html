              Start with what you have now. If you’re early in your career, the most important thing is to get your work out there and keep growing.
              Even if you’re not 100% confident the work is perfect or you don’t know exactly what to say about everything
              (especially the meaning of life!), get a portfolio online and start building a presence on creative community
              sites like Behance right away. You will refine your work and how you talk about it as you grow as a designer.
